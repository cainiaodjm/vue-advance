# 1.3 Mini Observer
## Goal

Combine the previous two functions ,renaming `convert()` to `observe()` and keeping `autorun`

-`observe()` converts the properties in the received object and make them reactive. For each
converted property, it get assigned a `Dep` instance which keep track  of a list of subscribing 
update function, and triggers them  to re-tun when its setter is invoked


-`autorun()` takes an update function  and re-runs it when properties that the update fucntion 
subscribes to have been mutated. An update function  is said  to be "subscribing" to property if 
it relies on that property during its evalution.


They should support the follow  usage:

``` js
 const  state ={
     count:0
 }
 observe(state)

 autorun(()=>{
     console.log(state.count)
 })
 //should  immediately log 'count is 0'

 state.count++
 //should log 'count is 1'
```
